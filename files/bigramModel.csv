这一阵为了工作上的关系花了点时间学习了一下lda算法说实话对于我这个学cs而非学数学的人来说除了集体智慧编程这本书之外基本没怎么看过机器学习的人来说一开始还真是摸不太到门道前前后后快要四个月了算是基本了解了这个算法的实现记录一下也供后来人快速入门做个参考。,一开始直接就下了blei的原始的那篇论文来看但是看了个开头就被dirichlet分布和几个数学公式打倒然后因为专心在写项目中的具体的代码也就先放下了。但是因为发现完全忘记了本科学的概率和统计的内容只好回头去看大学时候概率论的教材发现早不知道借给谁了于是上网买了本花了几天时间大致回顾了一遍概率论的知识什么贝叶斯全概率公式正态分布二项分布之类的。后来晚上没事儿的时候去水木的ai版转了转了解到了machine,1.0
